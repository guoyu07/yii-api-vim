*CApplicationComponent*   >> |CComponent|
=======================

 CApplicationComponent is the base class for application component classes.

 CApplicationComponent implements the basic methods required by
 |IApplicationComponent|.

 When developing an application component, try to put application component
 initialization code in the |CApplicationComponent::init| method instead of
 the constructor. This has the advantage that the application component can be
 customized through application configuration.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<behaviors>				*CApplicationComponent::behaviors*
 (array) the behaviors that should be attached to this component. The
 behaviors will be attached to the component when
 |CApplicationComponent::init| is called. Please refer to |CModel::behaviors|
 on how to specify the value of this property.

<isInitialized> 			*CApplicationComponent::isInitialized*
 (boolean) Checks if this application component has been initialized.

 component can be marked as initialized.
