*CAuthManager*   >> |CApplicationComponent| >> |CComponent|
==============

 CAuthManager is the base class for authorization manager classes.

 CAuthManager extends |CApplicationComponent| and implements some methods that
 are common among authorization manager classes.

 CAuthManager together with its concrete child classes implement the
 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

 The main idea is that permissions are organized as a hierarchy of
 |CAuthItem|. Items on higer level inherit the permissions represented by
 items on lower level. And roles are simply top-level authorization items that
 may be assigned to individual users. A user is said to have a permission to
 do something if the corresponding authorization item is inherited by one of
 his roles.

 Using authorization manager consists of two aspects. First, the authorization
 hierarchy and assignments have to be established. CAuthManager and its child
 classes provides APIs to accomplish this task. Developers may need to develop
 some GUI so that it is more intuitive to end-users. Second, developers call
 |IAuthManager::checkAccess| at appropriate places in the application code to
 check if the current user has the needed permission for an operation.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<authItems>				*CAuthManager::authItems*
 See |IAuthManager::authItems|

<behaviors>				*CAuthManager::behaviors*
 See |CApplicationComponent::behaviors|

<defaultRoles>				*CAuthManager::defaultRoles*
 (array) list of role names that are assigned to all users implicitly. These
 roles do not need to be explicitly assigned to any user. When calling
 |CAuthManager::checkAccess|, these roles will be checked first. For
 performance reason, you should minimize the number of such roles. A typical
 usage of such roles is to define an 'authenticated' role and associate it
 with a biz rule which checks if the current user is authenticated. And then
 declare 'authenticated' in this property so that it can be applied to every
 authenticated user.

<isInitialized> 			*CAuthManager::isInitialized*
 See |CApplicationComponent::isInitialized|

<operations>				*CAuthManager::operations*
 (array) Returns operations. This is a shortcut method to
 |IAuthManager::getAuthItems|.

<roles> 				*CAuthManager::roles*
 (array) Returns roles. This is a shortcut method to
 |IAuthManager::getAuthItems|.

<showErrors>				*CAuthManager::showErrors*
 (boolean) Enable error reporting for bizRules.

<tasks> 				*CAuthManager::tasks*
 (array) Returns tasks. This is a shortcut method to
 |IAuthManager::getAuthItems|.
