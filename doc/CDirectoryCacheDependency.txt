*CDirectoryCacheDependency*   >> |CCacheDependency| >> |CComponent|
===========================

 CDirectoryCacheDependency represents a dependency based on change of a
 directory.

 CDirectoryCacheDependency performs dependency checking based on the
 modification time of the files contained in the specified directory. The
 directory being checked is specified via
 |CDirectoryCacheDependency::directory|.

 By default, all files under the specified directory and subdirectories will
 be checked. If the last modification time of any of them is changed or if
 different number of files are contained in a directory, the dependency is
 reported as changed. By specifying
 |CDirectoryCacheDependency::recursiveLevel|, one can limit the checking to a
 certain depth of the directory.

 Note, dependency checking for a directory is expensive because it involves
 accessing modification time of multiple files under the directory.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<dependentData> 			*CDirectoryCacheDependency::dependentData*
 See |CCacheDependency::dependentData|

<directory>				*CDirectoryCacheDependency::directory*
 (string) the directory whose change is used to determine if the dependency
 has been changed. If any of the files under the directory is changed, the
 dependency is considered as changed.

<hasChanged>				*CDirectoryCacheDependency::hasChanged*
 See |CCacheDependency::hasChanged|

<namePattern>				*CDirectoryCacheDependency::namePattern*
 (string) the regular expression matching valid file/directory names. Only the
 matching files or directories will be checked for changes. Defaults to null,
 meaning all files/directories will qualify.

<recursiveLevel>			*CDirectoryCacheDependency::recursiveLevel*
 (integer) the depth of the subdirectories to be recursively checked. If the
 value is less than 0, it means unlimited depth. If the value is 0, it means
 checking the files directly under the specified directory.

<reuseDependentData>			*CDirectoryCacheDependency::reuseDependentData*
 See |CCacheDependency::reuseDependentData|

*CDirectoryCacheDependency::generateDependentData*		 protected
>
 generateDependentData()
<
(mixed) the data needed to determine if dependency has been changed.

 Generates the data needed to determine if dependency has been changed. This
 method returns the modification timestamps for files under the directory.


*CDirectoryCacheDependency::generateTimestamps* 		 protected
>
 generateTimestamps($directory, $level=0)
<
(array) list of file modification time indexed by the file path

 Determines the last modification time for files under the directory. This
 method may go recursively into subdirectories if
 |CDirectoryCacheDependency::recursiveLevel| is not 0.
    [directory] (string) the directory name
    [level] (integer) level of the recursion

*CDirectoryCacheDependency::validateDirectory*			 protected
>
 validateDirectory($directory)
<
(boolean) whether this subdirectory should be checked.

 Checks to see if the specified subdirectory should be checked for dependency.
 This method is invoked when dependency of the whole directory is being
 checked. By default, it always returns true, meaning the subdirectory should
 be checked. You may override this method to check only certain
 subdirectories.
    [directory] (string) the name of the subdirectory that may be checked for
    dependency.


*CDirectoryCacheDependency::validateFile*			 protected
>
 validateFile($fileName)
<
(boolean) whether this file should be checked.

 Checks to see if the file should be checked for dependency. This method is
 invoked when dependency of the whole directory is being checked. By default,
 it always returns true, meaning the file should be checked. You may override
 this method to check only certain files.
    [fileName] (string) the name of the file that may be checked for
    dependency.
