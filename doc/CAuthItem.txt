*CAuthItem*   >> |CComponent|
===========

 CAuthItem represents an authorization item. An authorization item can be an
 operation, a task or a role. They form an authorization hierarchy. Items on
 higher levels of the hierarchy inherit the permissions represented by items
 on lower levels. A user may be assigned one or several authorization items
 (called |CAuthAssignment|. He can perform an operation only when it is among
 his assigned items.
