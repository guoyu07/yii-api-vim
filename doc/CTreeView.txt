===========

 CTreeView displays a tree view of hierarchical data.

 It encapsulates the excellent tree view plugin for jQuery
 ('http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-treeview/').

 To use CTreeView, simply sets |CTreeView::data| to the data that you want to
 present and you are there.

 CTreeView also supports dynamic data loading via AJAX. To do so, set
 |CTreeView::url| to be the URL that can serve the tree view data upon
 request.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<actionPrefix>				*CTreeView::actionPrefix*
 See |CWidget::actionPrefix|

<animated>				*CTreeView::animated*
 (string|integer) animation speed. This can be one of the three predefined
 speeds ("slow", "normal", or "fast") or the number of milliseconds to run the
 animation (e.g. 1000). If not set, no animation is used.

<clientOptions> 			*CTreeView::clientOptions*
 (array) the javascript options

<collapsed>				*CTreeView::collapsed*
 (boolean) whether the tree should start with all branches collapsed. Defaults
 to false.

<control>				*CTreeView::control*
 (string) container for a tree-control, allowing the user to expand, collapse
 and toggle all branches with one click. In the container, clicking on the
 first hyperlink will collapse the tree; the second hyperlink will expand the
 tree; while the third hyperlink will toggle the tree. The property should be
 a valid jQuery selector (e.g. '#treecontrol' where 'treecontrol' is the ID of
 the 'div' element containing the hyperlinks.)

<controller>				*CTreeView::controller*
 See |CWidget::controller|

<cookieId>				*CTreeView::cookieId*
 (string) The cookie name to use when persisting via persist:"cookie".
 Defaults to 'treeview'.

<cssFile>				*CTreeView::cssFile*
 (mixed) the CSS file used for the widget. Defaults to null, meaning using the
 default CSS file included together with the widget. If false, no CSS file
 will be used. Otherwise, the specified CSS file will be included when using
 this widget.

<data>					*CTreeView::data*
 (array) the data that can be used to generate the tree view content. Each
 array element corresponds to a tree view node with the following structure:
   {text} string, required, the HTML text associated with this node.
   {expanded} boolean, optional, whether the tree view node is
   expanded.
   {id} string, optional, the ID identifying the node. This is used  
   in dynamic loading of tree view (see |CTreeView::url|).
   {hasChildren} boolean, optional, defaults to false, whether
   clicking on this   node should trigger dynamic loading of more
   tree view nodes from server.   The |CTreeView::url| property must
   be set in order to make this effective.
   {children} array, optional, child nodes of this node.
   {htmlOptions} array, additional HTML attributes (see
   |CHtml::tag|).   This option has been available since version
   1.1.7.Note, anything enclosed between the beginWidget and endWidget calls
 will also be treated as tree view content, which appends to the content
 generated from this data.

<htmlOptions>				*CTreeView::htmlOptions*
 (array) additional HTML attributes that will be rendered in the UL tag. The
 default tree view CSS has defined the following CSS classes which can be
 enabled by specifying the 'class' option here:
   treeview-black
   treeview-gray
   treeview-red
   treeview-famfamfam
   filetree

<id>					*CTreeView::id*
 See |CWidget::id|

<options>				*CTreeView::options*
 (array) additional options that can be passed to the constructor of the
 treeview js object.

<owner> 				*CTreeView::owner*
 See |CWidget::owner|

<persist>				*CTreeView::persist*
 (string) Persist the tree state in cookies or the page location. If set to
 "location", looks for the anchor that matches location.href and activates
 that part of the treeview it. Great for href-based state-saving. If set to
 "cookie", saves the state of the tree on each click to a cookie and restores
 that state on page load.

<prerendered>				*CTreeView::prerendered*
 (boolean) Set to skip rendering of classes and hitarea divs, assuming that is
 done by the serverside. Defaults to false.

<skin>					*CTreeView::skin*
 See |CWidget::skin|

<toggle>				*CTreeView::toggle*
 (string) Callback when toggling a branch. Arguments: "this" refers to the UL
 that was shown or hidden

<unique>				*CTreeView::unique*
 (boolean) set to allow only one branch on one level to be open (closing
 siblings which opening). Defaults to false.

<url>					*CTreeView::url*
 (string|array) the URL to which the treeview can be dynamically loaded (in
 AJAX). See |CHtml::normalizeUrl| for possible URL formats. Setting this
 property will enable the dynamic treeview loading. When the page is
 displayed, the browser will request this URL with a GET parameter named
 'root' whose value is 'source'. The server script should then generate the
 needed tree view data corresponding to the root of the tree (see
 |CTreeView::saveDataAsJson|.) When a node has a CSS class 'hasChildren', then
 expanding this node will also cause a dynamic loading of its child nodes. In
 this case, the value of the 'root' GET parameter is the 'id' property of the
 node.

<viewPath>				*CTreeView::viewPath*
 See |CWidget::viewPath|
